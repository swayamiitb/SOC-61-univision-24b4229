"""L5 — Adjudicator: orchestrate reasoning + safety into a final decision.

The Adjudicator is the single entry point the L4 server calls. It:
  1. sanitizes any free-text context before it reaches the reasoning core,
  2. asks the injected `ReasoningProvider` to score the validated detections,
  3. clamps the returned event so downstream consumers can trust its bounds.

This keeps the untrusted-input boundary and the output-contract boundary in
one place, independent of which LLM backend is wired in.
