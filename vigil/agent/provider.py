"""L5 — Reasoning provider interface.

The reasoning core is accessed through a single, narrow interface so the
LLM backend can be swapped without touching the graph. The default
implementation targets `freellmapi` (a free-tier gateway), but any object
satisfying `ReasoningProvider` can be injected.
